Class :
A class can be defined as a blueprint that describes the behaviour that the object of its type support.
it is a user defined data type which contains methods and variables.

Object :

Object is an instance of a class. Objects has state and behaviour.
for examples Dog is a class and barking, eating is can be object of the dog class.

If we consider a dog then its state is - Name, breed, color etc.
Behaviour of the dog is - Barking, running etc.


Class contains the variables as
1. Local variables - inside the scope of methods and constructors
2. Instance Variables - inside the class but outside of the methods. These variables are initialized when the class is
instantiated.
3. Class Variables - inside the class, outside of the method but with a static keyword.



? Recursive constructor invocation ?
calling to this() should be first statement in the body
this and super can not be used together
this cannot be used within the same constructor its calling


INHERITANCE
--------------

Inheriatnce - IS A relationship
Why ? to achive runtime polymorphism
to reuse the code


Types : Single, Multilevel, Hierarchical

Aggregation :code reuse is best achieved when there is no is-a relationship
Inheritance is used when the is-a relationship maintained throughout the life of the object otherwise use aggregation


METHOD OVERLOADING
------------------

if class has multiple methods with the same name
> it improved the readability of the program as the number of methods name will be less

two ways > change the number of arguments > change the data type
{can not be done by changing the return type of the methods-
ERROR message - method is already defined in the class ...}

Question : What is type promotion ????

METHOD OVERRIDING
-----------------
> used for runtime polymorphism
> same method name, same parameters, IS-A relationship



COVARIANT RETURN TYPE
---------------------
method overriding is possible while changing the return type
using non- primitive return type
such as class

SUPER Keyword
---------------
super refers to the immediate parent class object , method , constructor.

INSTANCE INITIALIZER BLOCK  ?????---??????
---------------------------
{
System.out.println("Block );
}

FINAL
---------
it can be class, method or variable as final
class can not be inherited , method can not be overridden , variable can not be changed.

Blank final variable - it is initialized at the time of object creation
it can be initialized but only in constructor


POLYMORPHISM
---------------
compile time / run time polymorphism

overload a static method is an example of compile time polymorphism


What is Upcasting ?and downcasting ????
if the ref variable of Parent class refers to the objet of the child class
Class A{} class B extends A{} A a = new B(); // this is the example of upcasting

runtime polymorphism can not be achived by data memebers


STATIC BINDING (Early Binding ) ???????? ---????????
----------------
static binding - when type of the object is determined at the compiled time.
if there is any private, static or final method in the class, there is static binding

dynamic binding - when the type of the object is determined at the runtime


INSTANCE_OF operator  ?????? - ??????????????
--------------------


ABSTRACTION
-----------------
abstract class - class with abstract keyword , it can have both abstract and non abstract methods
It is the process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the functionality to the user

abstract class - it can not be instantiated or can not create the object  , it can have constructors and static methods
abstract methods - it does not have implementation
Mostly we do not know about the implementation class(hidden to the end user) and an object of the
implementation class is provided by the factory method
